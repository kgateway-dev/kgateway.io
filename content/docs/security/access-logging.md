Capture an access log for all the requests that enter the gateway. 

## About access logging

Access logs, sometimes referred to as audit logs, represent all traffic requests that pass through the gateway proxy. The access log entries can be customized to include data from the request, the routing destination, and the response. 

Access logs can be written to a file, the `stdout` stream of the gateway proxy container, or exported to a gRPC server for custom handling. 

### Envoy data that can be logged

Envoy exposes a lot of data that can be used when customizing access logs. The following data properties are available for both TCP and HTTP access logging:

* The downstream (client) address, connection information, TLS configuration, and timing
* The upstream (service) address, connection information, TLS configuration, timing, and Envoy routing information
* Relevant Envoy configuration, such as rate of sampling (if used)
* Filter-specific context that is published to Envoy’s dynamic metadata during the filter chain

#### Additional HTTP properties 

When Envoy is used as an HTTP proxy, additional HTTP information is available for access logging, including:

* Request data, including the method, path, scheme, port, user agent, headers, body, and more
* Response data, including the response code, headers, body, and trailers, as well as a string representation of the response code
* Protocol version

## Set up access logging for `stdout`

1. Create a ListenerOption resource to define your access logging rules. The following example writes access logs to the `stdout` stream of the gateway proxy container by using a custom string format that is defined in the `jsonFormat` field. If no custom string format is defined, the [default Envoy format](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.14.1/configuration/observability/access_log#config-access-log-format-strings) is used.  
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: ListenerOption
   metadata:
     name: access-logs
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: http
     options:
       accessLoggingService:
         accessLog:
         - fileSink:
             path: /dev/stdout
             jsonFormat:
                 start_time: "%START_TIME%"
                 method: "%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-METHOD?:METHOD)%"
                 path: "%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)%"
                 protocol: "%PROTOCOL%"
                 response_code: "%RESPONSE_CODE%"
                 response_flags: "%RESPONSE_FLAGS%"
                 bytes_received: "%BYTES_RECEIVED%"
                 bytes_sent: "%BYTES_SENT%"
                 total_duration: "%DURATION%"
                 resp_upstream_service_time: "%RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)%"
                 req_x_forwarded_for: "%REQ(X-FORWARDED-FOR)%"
                 user_agent: "%REQ(USER-AGENT)%"
                 request_id: "%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%"
                 authority: "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%"
                 upstreamHost: "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
                 upstreamCluster: "%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%"
   EOF
   ```

2. Send a request to the httpbin app on the `www.example.com` domain. Verify that your request succeeds and that you get back a 200 HTTP response code.  
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   date: Fri, 07 Jun 2024 21:10:03 GMT
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 2
   server: envoy
   transfer-encoding: chunked
   ```
   
3. Get the logs for the gateway pod and verify that you see an entry for each request that you sent to the httpbin app. 
   ```sh
   kubectl -n gloo-system logs deployments/gloo-proxy-http | tail -1 | jq --sort-keys
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   {
     "authority": "www.example.com:8080",
     "bytes_received": 0,
     "bytes_sent": 0,
     "method": "GET",
     "path": "/status/200",
     "protocol": "HTTP/1.1",
     "req_x_forwarded_for": null,
     "request_id": "a6758866-0f26-4c95-95d9-4032c365c498",
     "resp_upstream_service_time": "0",
     "response_code": 200,
     "response_flags": "-",
     "start_time": "2024-08-19T20:57:57.511Z",
     "total_duration": 1,
     "upstreamCluster": "kube-svc:httpbin-httpbin-8000_httpbin",
     "upstreamHost": "10.36.0.14:8080",
     "user_agent": "curl/7.77.0"
   }
   ```
