title: AWS NLB
weight: 20
---

In this guide you explore how to expose the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} proxy with an AWS network load balancer (NLB). The following use cases are covered:

* **NLB HTTP**: Create an HTTP listener on the NLB that exposes an HTTP endpoint on your gateway proxy. Traffic from the NLB to the proxy is not secured. 
* **TLS passthrough**: Expose an HTTPS endpoint of your gateway with an NLB. The NLB passes through HTTPS traffic to the gateway proxy where the traffic is terminated. 

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Keep in mind the following considerations when working with an NLB: 
* {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} does not open any proxy ports until at least one HTTPRoute resource is created that references the gateway. However, AWS ELB health checks are automatically created and run after you create the gateway. Because of that, registered targets might appear unhealthy until an HTTPRoute resource is created. 
* An AWS NLB has an idle timeout of 350 seconds that you cannot change. This limitation can increase the number of reset TCP connections.

## Before you begin

1. Create or use an existing AWS account. 
2. Follow the [Get started guide](/docs/quickstart/) to install {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}, set up a gateway resource, and deploy the httpbin sample app.

## Step 1: Deploy the AWS Load Balancer controller

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/aws-elb-controller-install.md" >}}
   
## Step 2: Deploy your gateway proxy

Depending on the annotations that you use on your gateway proxy, you can configure the NLB in different ways. 

{{< tabs items="Simple HTTP NLB,TLS passthrough" >}}
{{% tab %}}

Follow these steps to create a simple NLB that accepts HTTP traffic on port 80 and forwards this traffic to the HTTP listener on your gateway proxy. 

{{< reuse-image src="/img/elb-http.svg" >}}

1. Create a GatewayParameters resource with custom AWS annotations. These annotations instruct the AWS load balancer controller to expose the gateway proxy with a public-facing AWS NLB. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.gloo.solo.io/v1alpha1
   kind: GatewayParameters
   metadata:
     name: custom-gw-params
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     kube: 
       service:
         extraAnnotations:
           service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "external" 
           service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing 
           service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "instance"
   EOF
   ```
   
   | Setting | Description | 
   | -- | -- | 
   | `aws-load-balancer-type: "external"` | Instruct Kubernetes to pass the Gateway's service configuration to the AWS load balancer controller that you created earlier instead of using the built-in capabilities in Kubernetes. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/nlb/#configuration). | 
   | `aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing ` | Create the NLB with a public IP addresses that is accessible from the internet. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/nlb/#prerequisites).  | 
   | `aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "instance"` | Use the Gateway's instance ID to register it as a target with the NLB. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/nlb/#instance-mode_1).  | 
   
2. Create a Gateway resource that references the custom GatewayParameters resource that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   kind: Gateway
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: aws-cloud
     namespace: gloo-system
     annotations:
       gateway.gloo.solo.io/gateway-parameters-name: "custom-gw-params"
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: gloo-gateway
     listeners:
     - protocol: HTTP
       port: 80
       name: http
       allowedRoutes:
         namespaces:
           from: All
   EOF  
   ```
   
3. Verify that your gateway is created. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get gateway aws-cloud -n gloo-system
   ```
   
4. Verify that the gateway service is exposed with an AWS NLB and assigned an AWS hostname. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get services gloo-proxy-aws-cloud -n gloo-system
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```console
   NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                                                                     PORT(S)        AGE
   gloo-proxy-aws-cloud   LoadBalancer   172.20.181.57   k8s-gloosyst-glooprox-e11111a111-111a1111aaaa1aa.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com   80:30557/TCP   12m
   ```

5. Review the NLB in the AWS EC2 dashboard. 
   1. Go to the [AWS EC2 dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2). 
   2. Go to **Load Balancing > Load Balancers**, and find and open the load balancer that was created for you. 
   3. On the **Resource map** tab, verify that the load balancer points to targets in your cluster. 

   {{< callout type="info" >}}
   {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} does not open any proxy ports until at least one HTTPRoute is associated with the gateway. The AWS ELB health checks are automatically created when you create the Gateway resource and might report that the gateway proxy  is unhealthy. Continue with this guide to create an HTTPRoute resource and send traffic through the NLB.
   {{< /callout >}}

6. Continue with [Step 3: Test traffic to the NLB](#test-traffic).

1. Create a GatewayParameters resource with custom AWS annotations. These annotations instruct the AWS load balancer controller to expose the gateway proxy with a public-facing AWS NLB. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.gloo.solo.io/v1alpha1

           service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "instance"
   EOF
   ```
   
   | Setting | Description | 
   | -- | -- | 
   | `aws-load-balancer-type: "external"` | Instruct Kubernetes to pass the Gateway's service configuration to the AWS load balancer controller that you created earlier instead of using the built-in capabilities in Kubernetes.

   | `aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing ` | Create the NLB with a public IP addresses and is accessible from the internet. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/nlb/#prerequisites).  | 
   | `aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "instance"` | Use the Gateway's instance ID to register it as a target with the NLB. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/nlb/#instance-mode_1).  | 

2. Create a self-signed TLS certificate to configure your gateway proxy with an HTTPS listener. 
   {{< reuse "docs/snippets/listeners-https-create-cert.md" >}}

3. Create a Gateway with an HTTPS listener that terminates incoming TLS traffic. Make sure to reference the custom GatewayParameters resource and the Kubernetes secret that contains the TLS certificate information. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: aws-cloud
     namespace: gloo-system
     labels:
       gateway: aws-cloud
     annotations:
       gateway.gloo.solo.io/gateway-parameters-name: "custom-gw-params"
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: gloo-gateway
     listeners:
       - name: https
         port: 443
         protocol: HTTPS
         hostname: https.example.com
         tls:
           mode: Terminate
           certificateRefs:
             - name: https
               kind: Secret
         allowedRoutes:
           namespaces:
             from: All
   EOF
   ```
   
4. Verify that your gateway is created. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get gateway aws-cloud -n gloo-system
   ```
   
5. Verify that the gateway service is exposed with an AWS NLB and assigned an AWS hostname.  
   ```sh
   kubectl get services gloo-proxy-aws-cloud -n gloo-system
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```console
   NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                                                                     PORT(S)        AGE
   gloo-proxy-aws-cloud   LoadBalancer   172.20.181.57   k8s-gloosyst-glooprox-e11111a111-111a1111aaaa1aa.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com   443:30557/TCP   12m
   ```

6. Review the load balancer in the AWS EC2 dashboard. 
   1. Go to the [AWS EC2 dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2). 
   2. Go to **Load Balancing > Load Balancers**. Find and open the load balancer that was created for you. 
   3. On the **Resource map** tab, and verify that the load balancer points to targets in your cluster. 

   {{< callout type="info" >}}
   {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} does not open any proxy ports until at least one HTTPRoute is associated with the gateway. The AWS ELB health checks are automatically created when you create the Gateway resource and might report that the gateway proxy is unhealthy. Continue with this guide to create an HTTPRoute resource and send traffic through the NLB.

1. Create an HTTPRoute resource and associate it with the gateway that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-elb
     namespace: httpbin
     labels:
       example: httpbin-route
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: aws-cloud
         namespace: gloo-system
     hostnames:
       - "www.nlb.com"
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

2. Get the AWS hostname of the NLB. 
   ```sh
   export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n gloo-system gloo-proxy-aws-cloud -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
   echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS
   ```

3. Send a request to the httpbin app. 
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/headers -H "host: www.nlb.com:80"
   ```

4. Go back to the AWS EC2 dashboard and verify that the NLB health checks now show a `Healthy` status.

   echo $INGRESS_GW_HOSTNAME
   export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(dig +short ${INGRESS_GW_HOSTNAME} | head -1)
   echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS
   ```

3. Send a request to the httpbin app. Verify that you see a successful TLS handshake and that you get back a 200 HTTP response code from the httpbin app. 
   ```sh
   curl -vik --resolve "https.example.com:443:${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}" https://https.example.com:443/status/200
