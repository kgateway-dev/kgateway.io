The configuration that is used to spin up a gateway proxy is stored in several custom resources, including GatewayParameters, Settings, and a gateway proxy template. By default, {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} creates these resources for you during the installation so that you can spin up gateway proxies with the [default proxy configuration](/docs/setup/default/). You have the following options to change the default configuration for your gateway proxies: 

| Option | Description | 
| -- | -- | 
| Create your own GatewayParameters resource (recommended) | To adjust the settings on the gateway proxy, you can create your own GatewayParameters resource. This approach allows you to spin up gateway proxies with different configurations. Keep in mind that you must maintain the GatewayParameters resources that you created manually. The values in these resources are not automatically updated during upgrades.  | 
| Change default GatewayParameters and Settings | You can change the values for the default GatewayParameters and Settings resources by updating the values in the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} Helm chart. Do not update the values in these resources directly as the values do not persist between upgrades. The values that you set in your Helm chart are automatically applied to the default GatewayParameters and Settings resources, and rolled out to the gateway proxies.  |
| Create self-managed gateways with custom proxy templates | If you want to change the [default gateway proxy template](/docs/setup/default/#gateway-proxy-template) and provide your own Envoy configuration to bootstrap the proxy with, you must create a self-managed gateway. For more information, see [Self-managed gateways (BYO)](/docs/setup/customize/selfmanaged). | 

## Customize the gateway proxy 

The example in this guide uses the GatewayParameters resource to change settings on the gateway proxy. To find other customization examples, see the [Gateway customization guides](/docs/setup/customize/).

1. Optional: Review the default configuration for your gateway proxies. This configuration can help you identify the settings that you want to change or add. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get gatewayparameters gloo-gateway -n gloo-system -o yaml
   ```

2. Create a GatewayParameters resource to add any custom settings to the gateway. The following example makes the following changes: 
   * The Kubernetes service type is changed to NodePort (default value: `LoadBalancer`). 
   * The `gateway: custom` label is added to the gateway proxy service that exposes the proxy (default value: `gloo=kube-gateway`). 
   * The `gateway: custom` label is added to the gateway proxy pod (default value: `gloo=kube-gateway` ). 
   * The security context of the gateway proxy is changed to use the 50000 as the supplemental group ID and user ID (default values: `10101` ).

   For other settings, see the [GatewayParameters proto file](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/projects/gateway2/api/v1alpha1/gateway_parameters_types.go) or check out the [Gateway customization guides](../).
   {{< /callout >}}
   
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.gloo.solo.io/v1alpha1
   kind: GatewayParameters
   metadata:
     name: custom-gw-params
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     kube: 
       service:
         type: NodePort
         extraLabels: 
           gateway: custom
       podTemplate: 
         extraLabels:
           gateway: custom
         securityContext: 
           fsGroup: 50000
           runAsUser: 50000
   EOF
   ```

3. Create a Gateway resource that references your custom GatewayParameters by using the `gateway.gloo.solo.io/gateway-parameters-name` annotation. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   kind: Gateway
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: custom
     namespace: gloo-system
     annotations:
       gateway.gloo.solo.io/gateway-parameters-name: "custom-gw-params"
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: gloo-gateway
     listeners:
     - protocol: HTTP
       port: 80
       name: http
       allowedRoutes:
         namespaces:
           from: All
   EOF
   ```

4. Verify that a pod is created for your gateway proxy and that it has the pod settings that you defined in the GatewayParameters resource. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=gloo-proxy-custom -n gloo-system -o yaml
   ```
   
   {{< callout type="info" >}}
   If the pod does not come up, try running `kubectl get events -n gloo-system` to see if the Kubernetes API server logged any failures. If no events are logged, ensure that the `gloo-gateway` GatewayClass is present in your cluster and that the Gateway resource shows an `Accepted` status.

   Example output:
   ```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[13,20,21,22],linenostart=1,filename="gateway-pod.yaml"}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     annotations:
       prometheus.io/path: /metrics
       prometheus.io/port: "9091"
       prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
     creationTimestamp: "2024-08-07T19:47:27Z"
     generateName: gloo-proxy-custom-7d9bf46f96-
     labels:
       app.kubernetes.io/instance: custom
       app.kubernetes.io/name: gloo-proxy-custom
       gateway: custom
       gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name: custom
       gloo: kube-gateway
   ...
     priority: 0
     restartPolicy: Always
     schedulerName: default-scheduler
     securityContext:
       fsGroup: 50000
       runAsUser: 50000
   ...
   ```

5. Get the details of the service that exposes the gateway proxy. Verify that the service is of type NodePort and that the extra label was added to the service. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get service gloo-proxy-custom -n gloo-system -o yaml
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[12,36],linenostart=1,filename="gateway-service.yaml"}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     creationTimestamp: "2024-08-07T19:47:27Z"
     labels:
       app.kubernetes.io/instance: custom
       app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
       app.kubernetes.io/name: gloo-proxy-custom
       app.kubernetes.io/version: 2.0.0-alpha1
       gateway: custom
       gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name: custom
       gloo: kube-gateway
       helm.sh/chart: gloo-gateway-0.0.1-alpha1
     name: gloo-proxy-custom
     namespace: gloo-system
     ownerReferences:
