## About
A timeout is the amount of time ([duration](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#duration)) that {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} waits for replies from an upstream service before the service is considered unavailable. This setting can be useful to avoid your apps from hanging or fail if no response is returned in a specific timeframe. With timeouts, calls either succeed or fail within a predicatble timeframe.

The time an app needs to process a request can vary a lot which is why applying the same timeout across services can cause a variety of issues. For example, a timeout that is too long can result in excessive latency from waiting for replies from failing services. On the other hand, a timeout that is too short can result in calls failing unnecessarily while waiting for an operation that needs responses from multiple services.

Timeouts can be configured for a route by using a RouteOption resource. Configuring gateway-level timeouts with a VirtualHostOption resource is not supported.

## Before you begin

## Set up timeouts {#timeouts}
   
Use a RouteOption resource to specify timeouts for a specific route. 

1. Create a RouteOption custom resource to specify your timeout rules. In the following example, the request must be completed within 20 seconds.  
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -n httpbin -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: RouteOption
   metadata:
     name: timeout
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     options:
       timeout: '20s'
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute resource for the httpbin app that references the RouteOption resource that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-timeout
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: gloo-system
     hostnames:
       - timeout.example
     rules:
       - filters:
           - type: ExtensionRef
             extensionRef:
               group: gateway.solo.io
               kind: RouteOption
               name: timeout
         backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a request to the httpbin app on the `timout.example` domain. Verify that the request succeeds and that you see a `X-Envoy-Expected-Rq-Timeout-Ms` header. If the header is present, {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} expects requests to the httpbin app to succeed within the set timeout. 
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/headers -H "host: timeout.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik localhost:8080/headers -H "host: timeout.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output for a successful response: 
   ```console {hl_lines=[12,13]}
   {
    "headers": {
      "Accept": [
        "*/*"
      ],
      "Host": [
        "timeout.example:8080"
      ],
      "User-Agent": [
        "curl/7.77.0"
      ],
      "X-Envoy-Expected-Rq-Timeout-Ms": [
        "20000"
      ],
      "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
        "http"
      ],
      "X-Request-Id": [
        "0ae53bc3-2644-44f2-8603-158d2ccf9f78"
      ]
    }
   }
   
   ```

4. Optional: Remove the resources that you created. 
   ```sh
   kubectl delete httproute httpbin-timeout -n httpbin
   kubectl delete routeoption timeout -n httpbin
   ```
