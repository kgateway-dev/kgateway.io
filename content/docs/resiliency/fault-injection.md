Test the resilience of your apps by injecting delays and connection failures into a percentage of your requests.

## About fault injections

You can set two following fault injection types in Gloo Gateway. 

* **Delays**: Delays simulate timing failures, such as network latency or overloaded upstreams.
* **Aborts**: Aborts simulate crash failures, such as HTTP error codes or TCP connection failures. 

Delays and aborts are independent of one another. When both values are set, your requests are either delayed only, delayed and aborted, or aborted only.

{{% callout type="info" %}}
Faults can be configured for a route by using a RouteOption resource. Gateway-level faults are not supported.
{{% /callout %}}

For more information, see the [Fault API](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/options/faultinjection/fault.proto.sk/).

## Aborts {#aborts}
   
Use a RouteOption resource to abort all incoming requests to a specific route. 

1. Create a RouteOption custom resource to specify your fault injection rules. In the following example, 50% of all requests are rejected with a 503 HTTP response code.  
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -n httpbin -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: RouteOption
   metadata:
     name: faults
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     options:
       faults:
         abort:
           percentage: 50
           httpStatus: 503
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute resource for the httpbin app that references the RouteOption resource that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-faults
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: gloo-system
     hostnames:
       - faults.example
     rules:
       - filters:
           - type: ExtensionRef
             extensionRef:
               group: gateway.solo.io
               kind: RouteOption
               name: faults
         backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a few requests to the httpbin app on the `faults.example` domain. Verify that some requests succeed with a 200 HTTP response code and other requests are rejected with a 503 HTTP response code.  
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: faults.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: faults.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output for a successful response: 
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 17:12:13 GMT
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 0
   server: envoy
   transfer-encoding: chunked
   ```
   
   Example output for a denied request: 
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
   content-length: 18
   content-type: text/plain
   date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 17:12:08 GMT
   server: envoy
   ```

4. Optional: Remove the resources that you created. 
   ```sh
   kubectl delete httproute httpbin-faults -n httpbin
   kubectl delete routeoption faults -n httpbin
   ```

## Delays {#delays}

Use a RouteOption resource to deny incoming requests to a specific route. 

1. Create a RouteOption custom resource to specify your fault injection rules. In the following example, 50% of all requests are delayed by 5 seconds.  
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -n httpbin -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: RouteOption
   metadata:
     name: faults
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     options:
       faults:
         delay:
           percentage: 50
           fixedDelay: '5s'
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute resource for the httpbin app that references the RouteOption resource that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-faults
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: gloo-system
     hostnames:
       - faults.example
     rules:
       - filters:
           - type: ExtensionRef
             extensionRef:
               group: gateway.solo.io
               kind: RouteOption
               name: faults
         backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a few requests to the httpbin app on the `faults.example` domain. Verify that some requests succeed immediately and other requests are delayed by 5 seconds.   
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: faults.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: faults.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output: 
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 17:18:51 GMT
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 0
   server: envoy
   transfer-encoding: chunked
   ```

4. Optional: Remove the resources that you created. 
   ```sh
   kubectl delete httproute httpbin-faults -n httpbin
   kubectl delete routeoption faults -n httpbin
   ```
