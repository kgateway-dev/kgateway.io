## Install a specific version of the CLI {#specific}

You can download a specific version of `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` directly from the GitHub releases page.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [{{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} project releases](https://github.com/kgateway-dev//k8sgateway/releases).
2. Choose the version of `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` to install.
3. Click the version of `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` that you want to install.
4. In the **Assets**, download the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` package that matches your operating system, and follow your operating system procedures for replacing your existing `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` binary file with the upgraded version.

## Upgrade the CLI

When it's time to upgrade {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}, make sure to update the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` CLI version before upgrading.

You can use the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} upgrade` command to upgrade or roll back the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` version. For example, you might change versions during an upgrade process, or when you have multiple versions of {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} across clusters that you manage from the same workstation. For more options, run `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} upgrade --help`.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Upgrading the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` CLI does _not_ upgrade the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} version that you run in your clusters.
{{< /callout >}}

1. Set the version to upgrade `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` to in an environment variable. Include the patch version.
   ```sh
   export CLI_VERSION=<version>
   ```
   
2. Upgrade your version of `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}`.
   ```bash
   {{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} upgrade --release v${CLI_VERSION}
   ```

3. Verify the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` CLI is installed and running the appropriate version. In the output, the **Client** is your local version. The **Server** is the version that runs in your cluster, and is `undefined` if {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} is not installed yet.
   ```bash
   {{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} version -o table
   ```

## Uninstall the CLI

To uninstall `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}`, you can delete the executable file from your system, such as on macOS in the following example.

```shell
rm ~/.gloo/bin/{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}
```

## Skew policy

Use the same version of the `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` CLI as the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} version that you installed in your cluster.

* Slight skews within minor versions typically work, such as `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` 1.18.1 and {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} 1.18.0.
* Compatibility across beta versions is not guaranteed, even within minor version skews.
* To resolve bugs in `{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}`, you might have to upgrade the CLI to a specific or latest version.
