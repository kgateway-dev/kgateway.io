Learn more about the components that make up k8sgateway. These components work together to provide traffic management, security, and resiliency for your apps.

## Component architecture

The following image shows the different components that make up the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} control and data plane. These components work together to translate gateway custom resources into Envoy configuration. The Envoy configuration controls the behavior of the gateway proxies that serve your apps.

{{< reuse-image src="img/translation.svg" >}}

1. The config and secret watcher components in the `gloo` pod watch the cluster for new Kubernetes Gateway API and {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} resources, such as Gateways, HTTPRoutes, or RouteOptions.
2. When the config or secret watcher detect new or updated resources, it sends the resource configuration to the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} translation engine. 
3. The translation engine translates Kubernetes Gateway API and {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} resources into Envoy configuration. All Envoy configuration is consolidated into an xDS snapshot. 
4. The reporter receives a status report for every resource that is processed by the translator. 
5. The reporter writes the resource status back to the etcd data store. 
6. The xDS snapshot is provided to the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} xDS server component in the `gloo` pod. 
7. Gateway proxies in the cluster pull the latest Envoy configuration from the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} xDS server.
8. Users send a request to the IP address or hostname that the gateway proxy is exposed on. 
9. The gateway proxy uses the listener and route-specific configuration that was provided in the xDS snapshot to perform routing decisions and forward requests to destinations in the cluster.


### Config watcher 

The config watcher component is part of the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} control plane and watches the cluster for new or updated Kubernetes Gateway API and {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} resources, such as Gateways, HTTPRoutes, and Upstreams. When the config watcher detects new or updated resources, it sends the Kubernetes configuration to the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} translation engine.

### Secret watcher

The secret watcher component is part of the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} control plane and watches a secret store for updates to secrets. For example, you might use a Kubernetes Secret to store the AWS access key and secret key credentials for an Upstream to access an AWS Lambda. However, you can configure {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} to also watch other secret stores.


### Endpoint discovery 

The endpoint discovery component is part of the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} control plane and watches service registries such as Kubernetes for IP addresses and hostnames that are associated with services. Each endpoint requires its own plug-in that supports the discovery functionality. For example, Kubernetes runs its own endpoint discovery goroutine. When endpoint discovery discovers a new or updated endpoint, the configuration is stored in etcd.

### Translation engine

The {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} translator receives snapshots of all the Kubernetes Gateway API, Kubernetes API, and {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} resources that you create or update. The translator starts a new translation loop for each update to translate these resources into valid Envoy configuration. The Envoy configuration is stored in an Envoy xDS snapshot.  

The following image shows the different stages of a translation cycle. 

{{< reuse-image src="img/translation-loop.svg" caption="k8sgateway translation cycle" >}}

1. The translation cycle starts by defining [Envoy clusters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto) from all configured Upstream and Kubernetes service resources. Clusters in this context are groups of similar hosts. Each Upstream has a type that determines how the Upstream is processed. Correctly configured Upstreams and Kubernetes services are converted into Envoy clusters that match their type, including information like cluster metadata.

2. The next step in the translation cycle is to process all the functions on each Upstream. Function-specific cluster metadata is added and is later processed by function-specific Envoy filters.

3. In the next step, all [Envoy routes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/route/v3/route.proto) are generated. Routes are generated for each route rule that is defined on the HTTPRoute and RouteOption resources. When all of the routes are created, the translator processes any VirtualHostOption, ListenerOption, and HttpListenerOption resources, aggregates them into [Envoy virtual hosts](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/route/v3/route_components.proto#config-route-v3-virtualhost), and adds them to a new [Envoy HTTP Connection Manager](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/http/http_connection_management) configuration. 

4. Filter plug-ins are queried for their filter configurations, generating the list of HTTP and TCP Filters that are added to the [Envoy listeners](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/listeners/listeners).

5. Finally, an xDS snapshot is composed of the all the valid endpoints (EDS), clusters (CDS), route configs (RDS), and listeners (LDS). The snapshot is sent to the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} xDS server. Gateway proxies in your cluster watch the xDS server for new config. When new config is detected, the config is pulled into the gateway proxy. 

### Reporter

The reporter component receives a validation report for every {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} resource that was processed by the translator. Any invalid configuration is reported back to the user through the Kubernetes storage layer. Invalid resources are marked as `rejected` and an error message is captured in the resource configuration.  

### xDS Server

The final snapshot is passed to the xDS Server, which notifies Envoy of a successful config update, updating the Envoy cluster with a new configuration to match the desired state set expressed by {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}.


## Discovery architecture

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/discovery-about.md" >}}

To enable automatic discovery of services, see [Discovery](/docs/traffic-management/destination-types/upstreams/#discovery). To learn more about Upstreams, see [Upstreams](/docs/traffic-management/destination-types/upstreams/).

The following image shows how the endpoint discovery component discovers Kubernetes services and Functions and automatically creates Upstream resources for them.
